## Boomtown 
Boomtown is a sharing app that allows users to post the items they're willing to share. It stores and displays the data of which users have borrwed which items, who the items originally belong to, and if items are available. During the first part of creating Boomtown I've created a page that displays all the items and the info on them, a user profile page, and a 404 and login page.

## Getting Started

When on the home screen, all items populate the page. A user has the option to filter the items based on category, or click on a certain user profile to see which items that user has.

## Built With
* React js
* Redux
* CSS 

## Learning

This has been a very challenging project due mostly to a lack of fluency with react and redux. I'm looking forward to digesting these tools more so that I can get a better grasp on things.

## Awknowledgements
Qingxin helped me with the filter function, there were several things that I just wasn't getting for what I had to do to make this work and she showed me what she had so I could get a functioning filter and better understand the process. As it stands now at the time of handing in part one I still have her code for that section of the project.
